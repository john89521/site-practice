# Site Practice
Just practicing HTML and CSS  

*1/3/2024*: need to add a big image then put text across it.

## Codespace Practice  
I am trying out Codespace from my iPad Air (M2).  
I think a lot of the GitHub documentation needs to be updated in regards to Codespace.  
Under this line, I will use an HTML comment. It should not be visible.  
<!-- This is a note for myself that will not be visible in the published document. -->
